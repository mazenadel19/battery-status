# Vite + TypeScript + React Template

This is a streamlined template for React applications using Vite, TypeScript, and a well-organized folder structure for efficient development.

## Project Structure

-   `src/`: Contains the source code of the application.
    -   `assets/`: Static assets such as images, fonts, etc.
    -   `components/`: Reusable UI components.
    -   `constants/`: Constants.
    -   `hooks/`: Custom hooks.
    -   `lib/`: Utility libraries.
    -   `pages/`: Application pages.
    -   `providers/`: Providers.
    -   `routes/`: Application routes.
    -   `services/`: Services.
    -   `stores/`: Stores.
    -   `types/`: Type definitions.
    -   `utils/`: Utility functions.
    -   `App.tsx`: Root component.
    -   `main.tsx`: Entry point.

This structure promotes better organization and scalability for your React projects.
